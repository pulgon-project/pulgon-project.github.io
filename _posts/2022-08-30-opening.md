Welcome to the web site of the PULGON project, scheduled to start on 2022-09-19. This initiative will study thermal transport in quasi-1D structures like nanotubes and nanowires with a solid foundation in symmetry. We are looking forward to sharing our progress with you once the project is ongoing.
